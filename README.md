# Transaction-Amount-Prediction
End-to-End ML Pipeline for High-Amount Transaction Prediction using Python &amp; Scikit-Learn

Project Overview

This project predicts whether a financial transaction is High Amount (> ₹2000) based on customer behavior and transaction features.
I built a complete Machine Learning pipeline that includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and model evaluation using Python and Scikit-Learn.

The project demonstrates how to:

Load and explore data

Perform feature engineering (Date → Day, Month, DayOfWeek)

Build preprocessing pipelines using ColumnTransformer

Scale numerical features using StandardScaler

Encode categorical features using OneHotEncoder

Train a logistic regression classifier

Evaluate model using

Accuracy

AUROC

Average Precision

Confusion Matrix
